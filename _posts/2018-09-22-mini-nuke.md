It's obvious that the battlefield is a very dangerous place. But it can be dangerous for the most mundane of reasons.

It turns out that one of the most dangerous of battlefield missions is the transport of fossil fuel to remote bases. And most of this fuel
is used not to power tanks or aircraft, but to produce electicity for the base.

The Defense One blog tells us how Los Alamos National Labs, working with various partners, is exploring the use of small nuclear reactors that can be used in the field.

These reactors are small enough to fit on a large truck, and use modern technology that substantially reduce the 
risk of catastrophic failures from operating them.

No pumps, and much simpler fail-safe systems that we're used to from legacy, large scale nuke plants, and from what
we've seen in the movies.

> Weâ€™re using technologies that have existed for decades, so they are proven safe and reliable. But previously there was no way to integrate those technologies together into a functioning system. Now, we are able use advanced manufacturing technologies and computational tools to build a new generation of safe, small, and simple transportable power systems.

But the buried lede here is that Los Alamos sees this tech as usable in many more places than just the battlefield. They say
it could be used in civilian emergency relief, such as power outages cause by severe weather or earthquakes, for everyday use in remote
areas, and even to power outposts on the moon or mars.

Cheap, safe, distributed powers sources.
