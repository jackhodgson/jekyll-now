[Fully Charged](https://www.youtube.com/user/fullychargedshow/) is a YouTube channel about the modern use of electricity.

It mostly focusses on electric vehicles. Cars, scooters, boats, and sometimes planes. It also occasionally explores modern electric use in the home and workplace. Both harvesting power, storing it, and distributing it.

Here's one episode about an electric vehicle that I found particularly fascinating.
