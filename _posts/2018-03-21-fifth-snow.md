It's gonna snow again.

For ME this is the second big snowstorm of the winter. (I was here for the first big snow back in January.) But for everyone else this is the 5th big storm of the winter.

Forecast for here at Lookout Point is 4 inches or less. Fingers crossed.

Hopefully it's the last one for the season.
