The news is buzzing about Trump's failure in his recent phone call with Russian dictator Putin, to challenge Putin about the British Nerve Agent Attack, and the Russion Interference with our elections.

It seems pretty clear to me that the Russians have some hold over Trump. They have something, and maybe have made threats, that scares Trump. And that Trump is doing things to avoid having these threats realized.

I think these things are true, but I also think there's an even simpler explanation for his failure in this recent phone call.

Trump didn't challenge Putin because Trump is a coward. He is afraid of confrontation.

It's well known, and we've seen it multiple times since his inaugeration, that he's afraid to fire people who work for him.

Trump is a cowardly bully.
